# As Built

Append-only completion log. One entry per F-ID, written by `/complete-feature`
at the moment of completion, describing what was actually built rather than what
was planned.

Entries are never edited after the fact. When a later story changes something
recorded here, the later story gets its own entry. The design intent lives in
`docs/hld/`, the plan lives in `.claude/plans/F-XXX-design.md`, and this file is
the record of what happened.

Newest entries at the bottom.

## Entry template

```markdown
### F-XXX, Short title

**Sprint.** SNN
**Completed.** YYYY-MM-DD
**Size.** S | M | L, estimated N days, actual N days

**What was built.** One paragraph. What exists now that did not before, in terms
a reader who has not seen the diff can follow.

**Non-obvious choices.** Anything a future reader would otherwise have to
reverse-engineer from the code, and the reason for it. Rejected alternatives
belong here, not in a comment.

**Deviations from the design plan.** What changed between
`.claude/plans/F-XXX-design.md` and the implementation, and why. "None" is a
valid and common answer.

**Spec sections touched.** The `docs/hld/` sections this story implements or
contradicts. If it contradicts one, say which and confirm the spec was updated.

**Tests.** The test gate from `docs/hld/14-development-backlog.md`, plus any
others added. Name them.

**Hash harness.** Unchanged, or the expected delta and its justification.
Mandatory for every story in M1 through M6.

**Notes for future sessions.** Anything that will not be obvious in three
months. Traps found, assumptions made, follow-up worth filing.
